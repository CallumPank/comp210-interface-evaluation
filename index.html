									<p> I have done a series of questionaires qualatative and quantatative. They have looked at the useability of the game "Kuthwala".

									<h2 class="major">Methodology</h2>
									<p> These interviews that I have conducted will mostly collect quantative data. The reason I did this was to collect a larger sample size as opposed to smaller sample size with better quality information the reason for this was time constraints and people did not want to fill out long forms so I switched to quantative to fix this.
     I collected the data by having participants play the game "Kuthwala" and then interview them afterwards. This helped me to see how they play and depending on their experience with these types of games what they thought of the game.
   The data that I have collected is mostly on the experience that they had with the game for example "How Immersive Was The Experience?" and what the controls of the game were like</p>

									<h2> Invisible Walls </h2>
									<p>Looking at the answers from participants it is obvious that a major “bug” is the fact that players can skip major parts of the game by taking advantage of the holes found in the invisible walls throughout the game. 3 of the 4 participants that I have interviewed said that skipping the level made the game less fun and broke how into the game they were. This meant that they cut a major amount of time off the game time and missed out on 4 puzzles. Although all of them said that they felt immersed into the game which showed that the game was interesting even with the invisible wall bug. </p>

									<h2> Invisible Walls Fix </h2>
									<p>From the results I could see that this bug is a major problem and made the game less fun for most of the participants. But from watching them play the game as I sat next to them when they played through the game. I could see where they were breaking through which makes it very easy to fix. Another problem with this is that one of the characters (Panther) made it incredibly easy to do this as you could jump across the map, so to stop this the panther character would need to be tweaked so that the character cannot jump as far and as high. </p>

									<h2> Character Selection </h2>
									<p>This is a problem that came up from participants during the qualitative and interview process where they would play the panther more than the bear some participants did not even play the bear, one of the questions in my quantitative was what character the participants played the most and unanimously they chose the panther, a few of the participants gave their opinions as to why this was. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Results</h2>
									<p>The first set of results that I am going to look at are "Was The game Fun? vs. How Immersive Was The Immersive?" as can be seen by the graph there is a positive correlation in results the mean was 5.93. 1 being the game was not fun at all and 10 being the game was incredibly fun. </p>

									<h2>Level Skipping</h2>
									<p>One of the major problems found with the game were that most of the levels could be skipped although the game was still rated on average to be fun, I was told by participants that this broke the immersion of the game and made it less enjoyable for some while for others they found it more enjoyable that the game was broken. </p>

								<div class="content span-10">

									<h2>Character Selection</h2>
									<p>Another part of the game that was found to be lacking was the characters as most participants exclusively played the panther as they could get over obstacles and past parts of the world that you were meant to complete as the bear but could bypass because of the panthers overall superior speed and jumping ability. This made some of the game lose purpose as it broke the immersion and fun of the game was taken away as you could just run past it or cheat your way to the end of the level this is evidenced by how fast some participants were able to reach 4th section of the level which was a falling pillar. Some participants being able to clear it in 20 seconds utilising the use of the broken walls and being able to jump over most of the puzzles. </p>

								<div class="content span-10">
									<h2 class="major">Results</h2>
									<h2>Character Selection Fix</h2>
									<p>From the results I could see that this is a major problem with the game as the game became broken and more boring because one character was more over powered than the other and using the results from the qualitative data sheet I could see that it was because the bear was too slow and the panther was too fast. The way that this could be fixed is by tuning the panther to be slower and the bear to be more useful, in that it is absolutely necessary for the bear to be used so that there is a balance.  </p>

									<h2>Tooltips and Control Menu</h2>
									<p>Another issue that was brought up during play testing was that the controls were not displayed unless you found the prompts that were found around the beginning of the level, this made it annoying for some participants as they wanted to start but had to figure out the controls themselves or walk around the beginning of the level. Adding onto this the objective of the game was very vague and participants did not feel immersed as they did not know the motivation or story behind the world or the player most participants said that the objective was to “Complete all the puzzles” but this was said in a way that they were not sure leaving them confused as to what the purpose of the character and the game were. </p>

								<div class="content span-10">
									<h2 class="major">Results</h2>
									<h2>Tooltips and Control Menu Fix</h2>
									<p>From the results I can see that It would be useful to include a menu with the controls on so that players do not have to wait around the first part of the level looking for the prompts, also another way to fix this is to make the prompts really obvious at the moment they are invisible boxes that players would have to actively look for. This would make it much easier for players to find them and be able to get into the game faster. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
									<h2>Tooltips and Control Menu Fix</h2>
									<p>This user interface task has allowed me to find problems contained within the game "Kuthwala" mainly to do with the immersion of the game and whether the game wa considered fun amongst the participants.</br>
									
									When carrying out the research trying to make questions precise enough that they could not be interpreted diffrently proved to be very hard such as questions like "How Immersive Was The Experience?" this meant that the results varied depending on what the interpretation of the participants was.</br>
									
									Through this research I was able to find glaring bugs within the game and some small ones that would make the game more interesting and fun for the players involved. The data and feedback gathered reflects this.</br>
									
									To continue with this I would do some more studies on the game such as a heuristic evaluation and to update my questionaires with more relevant questions and more in depth questions that cannot be interpreted so easily.</p>
