          <h2>Overview:</h2>
         </p>
       
      These interviews that I have conducted will mostly collect quantative data. The reason I did this was to collect a larger sample size as opposed to smaller sample size with better quality information the reason for this was time constraints and people did not want to fill out long forms so I switched to quantative to fix this.</br>
     I collected the data by having participants play the game "Kuthwala" and then interview them afterwards. This helped me to see how they play and depending on their experience with these types of games what they thought of the game.</br>
   The data that I have collected is mostly on the experience that they had with the game for example "How Immersive Was The Experience?" and what the controls of the game were like.

          <h2> Methodology:</h2>
         </p>
         To make my results more indepth I have interviewed them  both qualatatativly and quantativly, this way the results that I obtain are mixed to show a good varied amount of feedback.Although qualatative is very time consuming because of the nature of going for quality over quantity but I find this to be justified as the answers that I have recieved have given me insight into the "Kuthwala" that quantatative questions can not.</br>
